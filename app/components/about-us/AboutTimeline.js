The first centre came to life inside a 5,000 sq. ft. villa — built out with refurbished materials, second-hand furniture, and a lot of late nights! There was no blueprint, just a big idea and a team willing to figure things out as they went.",

P.S. We were brewing 350+ cups a day. Mostly strong. By April 2019, Spring House had 2,00,000 sq. ft. of workspace across NCR. In August, we launched our 30,000 sq. ft. flagship at Grand Mall, MG Road — a 500+ seater buzzing with freelancers, startups, teams… and a few dogs.That’s when it really started to feel big.",

But we got to work:- Strengthening our backend processes and building operational infrastructure from the ground. - Keeping the team close, motivated, and better skilled for whatever was coming next Tough year. Big lessons.",

In 2023, we grew faster than we expected — a 161.16% jump in revenue and a 125.27% rise in profit over the previous year. Still the same team spirit. Just a little more spreadsheet-savvy.",
